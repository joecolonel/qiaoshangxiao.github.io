excerpt: 'Oxidation ditch (OD) as a widely used process in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) usually produces low-flow zones at the ditch bottom, which leads to potential sludge deposition. In response to this issue, this study optimized the rectangular cross-section of the OD by proposing a U-shaped configuration, and used the numerical simulation method (Flunet 6.3.26) to simulate the hydraulic characteristics in the OD with the two types of cross-section. Comparative analysis of the simulated flow field structure and gas-phase distributions between the rectangular and U-shaped cross-sections indicates that the “U-shaped” OD exhibits superior hydraulic characteristics, and can provide a foundation for further advancements in OD design.'

# Abstract
Oxidation ditch (OD) as a widely used process in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) usually produces low-flow zones at the ditch bottom, which leads to potential sludge deposition. In response to this issue, this study optimized the rectangular cross-section of the OD by proposing a U-shaped configuration, and used the numerical simulation method (Flunet 6.3.26) to simulate the hydraulic characteristics in the OD with the two types of cross-section. Comparative analysis of the simulated flow field structure and gas-phase distributions between the rectangular and U-shaped cross-sections indicates that the “U-shaped” OD exhibits superior hydraulic characteristics, and can provide a foundation for further advancements in OD design.
