excerpt: 'Plug-and-play priors (PnP) is a methodology for regularized image reconstruction that specifies the prior through an image denoiser. While PnP algorithms are well understood for denoisers performing \emph{maximum a posteriori probability (MAP)} estimation, they have not been analyzed for the \emph{minimum mean squared error (MMSE)} denoisers. This letter addresses this gap by establishing the first theoretical convergence result for the iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm (ISTA) variant of PnP for MMSE denoisers. We show that the iterates produced by PnP-ISTA with an MMSE denoiser converge to a stationary point of some global cost function. We validate our analysis on sparse signal recovery in compressive sensing by comparing two types of denoisers, namely the \emph{exact} MMSE denoiser and the \emph{approximate} MMSE denoiser obtained by training a deep neural net.'

# Abstract
Oxidation ditch (OD) as a widely used process in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) usually produces low-flow zones at the ditch bottom, which leads to potential sludge deposition. In response to this issue, this study optimized the rectangular cross-section of the OD by proposing a U-shaped configuration, and used the numerical simulation method (Flunet 6.3.26) to simulate the hydraulic characteristics in the OD with the two types of cross-section. Comparative analysis of the simulated flow field structure and gas-phase distributions between the rectangular and U-shaped cross-sections indicates that the “U-shaped” OD exhibits superior hydraulic characteristics, and can provide a foundation for further advancements in OD design.
