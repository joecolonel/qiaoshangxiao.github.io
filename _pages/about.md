Nice to meet you here!

I am Xiaojian Xu, a junior but passionate researcher working on computational imaging! I am currently a postdoc student in the EECS department at University of Michigan (UMich), working with [Prof. Jeffrey Fessler]( https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/).

I got my PhD degree in Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) in 2022, where I had the fortune to work with [Prof. Ulugbek Kamilov](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Ulugbek-Kamilov.html) in the Computational Imaging Group (CIG). Before I came to WashU, I got my  B.S. degree in Communication and Information Engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2014,  recommend as an exam-free student to the graduate school, and then got my M.S. degree in Communication and Information Systems there in 2017. 

My research interests include computational imaging, inverse problems, optimization theory, computer vision and deep learning. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in our research! 


<h2>I am currently on the job market.</h2>

Before I came to WashU, I got my B.Eng. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2014 and then was recommend as an exam-free student to the graduate school of UESTC and later got my M.S. degree there in 2017. Back then, I majored in communication and information engineering and did most of my research in wireless and computer network engineering. It was a very helpful and interesting journey and I always appreciate what I have learned in that field. Besides, UESTC is located in Chengdu, a city full of good food. I enjoied my seven years there a lot!
I am always attracted by the beauty of mathematical analysis and I feel so lucky to be able to join the CIG group after I came to WashU. CIG is a pretty cool place and I learned a lot here from my advisor and groupmates. My research of interests includes computational imaging, optimization theory,computer vision and machine learning. Feel free to follow us if you think our research is interesting!
