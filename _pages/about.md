Nice to meet you here!

I am Shangxiao Qiao, a junior but passionate researcher specializing in wastewater treatment. Currently, I am a second-year PhD student at Xi'an University of Technology. My research focuses on oxidation ditches, constructed wetlands, and numerical simulations for improving wastewater treatment processes.

In 2017, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Water Supply and Drainage Science and Engineering from Xi'an University of Technology, and later obtained my Master's degree in Municipal Engineering in 2020 from the same institution. After graduation, I worked in the wastewater treatment design industry for three years, which enriched my practical experience in designing wastewater treatment systems.

My research interests include wastewater treatment, advanced oxidation processes, constructed wetlands, and computational modeling. If you are interested in our research, feel free to contact me!

Before I came to WashU, I got my B.Eng. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2014 and then was recommend as an exam-free student to the graduate school of UESTC and later got my M.S. degree there in 2017. Back then, I majored in communication and information engineering and did most of my research in wireless and computer network engineering. It was a very helpful and interesting journey and I always appreciate what I have learned in that field. Besides, UESTC is located in Chengdu, a city full of good food. I enjoied my seven years there a lot!
I am always attracted by the beauty of mathematical analysis and I feel so lucky to be able to join the CIG group after I came to WashU. CIG is a pretty cool place and I learned a lot here from my advisor and groupmates. My research of interests includes computational imaging, optimization theory,computer vision and machine learning. Feel free to follow us if you think our research is interesting!
